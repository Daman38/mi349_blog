            <p>It has been about a month since Counter-Strike 2s official release, and Valve have been busy pushing update after update as the community continues to discover glitches and bugs within the game. On October 25th, another update brought surprise and satisfaction to many in the Counter-Strike community, one focused on changing and polishing most maps within CS2. While most maps received general lighting and clipping improvements, there are a few notable changes within the update. The most notable change comes within the map Inferno, where a section of railing near the A site balcony has been removed, allowing for better access into the site from the apartments. This change can be seen in the image below. Additionally, a bug where self-inflicted incendiary damage counted as team damage has been patched. Furthermore, Valve continues to tweak weapon skins and stickers as they transition from CS:GO to CS2. The most notable adjustment in the update comes for the Desert Eagle, where sticker sizes have been reduced in order to prevent strange sticker placements. This update has been the most impactful since the “Smooth Criminal” foot-clipping bug was patched nearly two weeks prior. Counter-Strike fans are happy to see their game being improved, however many are still frustrated with the lack of content since its release, leaving many wondering when the next big update will be.<img alt="Photo of updated blacony on CS2 Inferno" src="images/cs2balcony.jpg" width="700"/></p><div class="caption"><p>Image depicting removed railing</p></div>

            <p><img alt="Photo of FaZe Clan lifting their trophy" src="images/cs2faze.png" width="700"/>Counter-Strike 2’s first ever competitive tournament has concluded, with FaZe Clan defeating Complexity 2-1 to take the game’s maiden tournament victory. Coming off a disappointing quarter finals exit at CS:GO’s final major tournament in Paris, FaZe Clan made their statement as the team to beat in Counter-Strike 2. FaZe initially struggled in the tournament, their initial loss to GamerLegion relegating them to the lower bracket. FaZe slowly but surely continued out of the group stage, before taking convincing 2-0 victories in both the quarterfinals and semifinals against strong opposition ENCE and MOUZ, going on to the finals to defeat Complexity 2-1 in a thrilling comeback victory. FaZe player ‘rain’ also won MVP in the tournament, the Norwegian player leading the scoresheets after overtime on the final map. The score of the final match can be seen above. FaZe Clan received a prize of $100,000 for winning the 6-day tournament, a hefty sum compared to the $42,000 taken by runner-up Complexity. As Counter-Strike 2 continues to be updated by the developers, some question if it is ready to be a competitive eSport like its predecessor. But Counter-Strike die-hards like myself are just happy to see the professionals playing.
