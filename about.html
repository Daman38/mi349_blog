        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>My name is Drake Wharton, and I am the author of this blog. I am currently a student at Michigan State University, studying Information Science. My hobbies include gaming, soccer, and driving my car. I was inspired to make this blog as I am a very avid gamer, and have played competitive Counter-Strike on university teams. A list of games I play competitively are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Counter-Strike</li>
            <li>FIFA</li>
            <li>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</li>
        </ul>
